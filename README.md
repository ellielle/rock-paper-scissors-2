### Rock Paper Scissors

This is my second take on the RPS project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav)
after having completed the Ruby / Ruby on Rails courses.

My first attempt can be found [here](https://github.com/ellielle/rock-paper-scissors).

I forgot most of the earlier lessons on JavaScript so I decided to go back and redo them as a refresher before heading deeper into the language.
